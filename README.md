# ESP32 DeskDog ROM（For small size TFT LCD)

**ESP32 DeskDog ROM** is a customized firmware based on the open-source [xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) project, designed for ESP32-powered desktop robot dogs.

This project keeps the core functionality of the original firmware while adding **real-time AI voice reply text display** on the device screen. This allows users to clearly read the robot dog's responses while interacting through voice.


## Features
* Real-time AI reply text display
* Voice interaction with cloud-based AI services
* Emotional expression animations
* Wi-Fi connectivity
* Support for cloud LLM services such as Qwen and DeepSeek
* OTA-ready
* Pre-built `.bin` firmware files included
* Modified source code included for further development
  
## Firmware
The repository provides pre-built firmware files that can be flashed directly to a compatible ESP32 device.
> **Note:** If multiple `.bin` files are provided, all required firmware files must be flashed to their corresponding addresses. Please check the included firmware configuration or flashing instructions before flashing.
>

## Flashing

You can flash the firmware using an ESP32 flashing tool such as **ESP-IDF**, **esptool**, or another compatible ESP32 flash utility.
The exact flash addresses depend on the firmware configuration and board being used.
**Make sure to back up your original firmware before flashing.**
